# Configurable-Frequency-Divider
Configurable Frequency Divider Mini-Project for Digital Electronics II

## Installation
Click [here](https://github.com/Mark5431/Adjustable-Frequency-Divider/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to install the entire directory as a .zip file. Unzip and put into your own FPGA simulation folders.

## Usage
1) Set your desired duty cycle in fractions compared to the period (0-6) on the first positive edge.
2) Set your desired period (2-6) on the second positive edge.

## Example
eg: Duty Cycle = 3, Period = 5,
    Output: 111001110011100..

NOTE: Duty cycle should not exceed period in any cases when simulating.
